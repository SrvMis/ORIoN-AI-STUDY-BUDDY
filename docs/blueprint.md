## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Focused blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and focus.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), very desaturated, providing a calm and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly deeper blue (#303F9F) analogous to the primary color to highlight important elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' provides a slightly techy and contemporary feel, making it perfect for headlines. 'Inter' works well for longer stretches of text, and complements the 'Space Grotesk' choice nicely.
